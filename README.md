Please Take Good Picture of Me :(

This is a simple camera web app that helps you take better photos by letting you place a reference picture behind the camera view. The goal is to make it easier to recreate a pose, match a previous photo, or align yourself with a specific composition without guessing.



I built it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be shared easily and added to the home screen like a native mobile app. :)) 

There is a button to upload a reference image, which appears behind the live camera view with adjustable transparency. When the photo is captured, the final image is saved to the device.
